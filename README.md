# original description

## Academic Project

An Agile¹ Project Management tool built using Google Web Toolkit with GWT-Platform and MongoDB (w/ Morphia).

After some time, renamed to GPA - "Gerenciador de Projetos Ágeis" (in PT-BR), something like "Agile Project Manager".

¹ Originally, it was Scrum, now, could be basically any type of agile project.
